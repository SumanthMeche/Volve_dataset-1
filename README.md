# Volve_dataset-1
Simple Ml regression models applied on Volve Dataset <br>
- Performed EDA <br>
- Selected features based on Linear relationship between variables<br>
             (Some variables are non linearly related)<br>
Split Data into 70:30::training:testing (60::40 & 80::20 perform worse on this Dataset)<br>
Used ML models to forecast Oil Production <br>
     - Multi Linear Regression<br>
     - KNN Regressor<br>
     - Decision Tree<br>
     - Random Forest<br>
     - Gradient Boosting<br>
     - XGB <br>
     - Support Vector Machine (with 3 different Kernels = rbf, poly & sigmoid<br>
Evaluated Model using different errors <br>
Have to test for more metrics in future, need to do PCA to reduce data dimension<br>
Use Deep Learning methods on Time series Data<br>
